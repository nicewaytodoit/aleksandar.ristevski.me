Coding largely depends on someone’s talent but also a willingness to dedicated enough hours shaping his mind as a tool of the trade. Even when things falling apart, even when requirements look impossible, in some strange way it is ok, those things make our job enjoyable. Solving those everyday Gordian knots and small puzzles make our work interesting.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 960px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/aleksandar.ristevski.me/static/cec61627f99a865d8c2a6cd66179ab80/eea4a/wise.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAANABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQFBv/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC/9oADAMBAAIQAxAAAAGmqqtNaQkB/8QAGRAAAwEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDABIE/9oACAEBAAEFAqPws/QS+o5bTPOF23//xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQ/9oACAEDAQE/AT//xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQ/9oACAECAQE/AT//xAAbEAACAQUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARACEkFhgf/aAAgBAQAGPwLYqXmOFyj/xAAbEAEAAgIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABABExQRAhUf/aAAgBAQABPyEburYJUmvji5XUI3IRZqf/2gAMAwEAAgADAAAAEPcP/8QAFhEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAER/9oACAEDAQE/EGx//8QAFREBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABH/2gAIAQIBAT8Qqv/EABsQAQACAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAESExQXGB/9oACAEBAAE/EHyaGbmEDV0rB7LgJ61B3G6HXZq4RUtP/9k='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\" wise.\"\n        title=\" wise.\"\n        src=\"/aleksandar.ristevski.me/static/cec61627f99a865d8c2a6cd66179ab80/6a068/wise.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/aleksandar.ristevski.me/static/cec61627f99a865d8c2a6cd66179ab80/09b79/wise.jpg 240w,\n/aleksandar.ristevski.me/static/cec61627f99a865d8c2a6cd66179ab80/7cc5e/wise.jpg 480w,\n/aleksandar.ristevski.me/static/cec61627f99a865d8c2a6cd66179ab80/6a068/wise.jpg 960w,\n/aleksandar.ristevski.me/static/cec61627f99a865d8c2a6cd66179ab80/eea4a/wise.jpg 1280w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>The development makes a significant portion of my life, but it is not all. There are days when I do not want to touch a keyboard or look at anything with a screen.\nIt is necessary to rest to achieve success; rest gives our brains time to reorganize neural pathways and find solutions. As in order to solve challenging problems, we have to look outside of the box, and it is easier to do that if we don’t always look through the same frame.</p>\n<p>Indoors, when I am not coding, you will find me drawing, playing with Fusion 360 and having a very live argument with my 3d printer. Yes, I am that person, one who talks with the hardware. First of all, the term is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging\">Rubber duck debugging</a> and secondly you just wait a few years, one day AI will catchup and then who will have the last laugh. ;)</p>\n<p>From time to time I read a random recommended novel, or watch some Sci-fi movie or series (no I have not watched Lost, one has to draw a line somewhere).\nEnglish is my second language, and as a way to improve my language skills, from time to time I will make youtube clips, or write different essays on a range of topics, posting them on a few of my blogs. </p>\n<p>No, I am not a writer - I just write, and in that regard, I can relate to Alan Watts philosophical impression that we should not identify with the things we do.\nTherefore, we are not programmers, writers, travellers… but, instead, beings of infinite potential choosing to do things as coding, writing, singing, drawing, running… meaning we are not ‘nouns’ but ‘verbs’.</p>\n<p>Outdoors, I like being lost in urban exploring, architecture, galleries, museums and theatres. From time to time, I don’t mind pint or two, but I am not much of a drinker, so please do not expect I will follow you in your Friday drinking spree as a way to socialize. </p>\n<p>At the end, it is worth mentioning that along with meditation, long walks, archery and hiking, travelling is my way to shift perspective. In my experience, that is an excellent way to come up with new and exciting ideas.</p>\n<p>If you were hoping to find my achievements and similar profile content, go to Work section, and if that is not enough, pop me a line or two, and I will send you my most recent CV in pdf.</p>","timeToRead":2,"frontmatter":{"title":"About me","date":null,"description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/about"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
